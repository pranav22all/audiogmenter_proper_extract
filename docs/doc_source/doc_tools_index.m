%% Function reference
% In this section we present the functions included in the Augmentation
% Toolbox. We provide two simple functions that apply some of the available
% data augmentation algorithms with fixed parameters. These functions are 
% the ones used in the Augmentation Examples included in this documentation.

%% CreateDataAUGFromAudio.m
% This function enables data augmentation directly from audio
% files. It is possibile to choose among 15 augmentation algorithms.

%% CreateDataAUGFromSpectrogram.m
% This function enables spectrogram augmentation from an original
% spectrograms. It is possible to choose among 8 augmentation algorithms.

%% Functions for augmentation for audio signals
% This Section contains the methods for augmenting the raw audio files.

%% Functions for augmentation for spectrograms
% This Section contains the methods for augmenting the spectrograms.
