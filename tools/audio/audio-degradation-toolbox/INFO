*** THE AUDIO DEGRADATION TOOLBOX ***

The Audio Degradation Toolbox (ADT) consists of Matlab code for the controlled degradation of audio signals, and for the adaptation of ground-truth to the degraded audio. Main purpose is to test the robustness of audio analysis methods against certain classes of degradations of the audio quality.

The ADT was conceived and developed by Sebastian Ewert and Matthias Mauch at the Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary, University of London.

** Getting Started **

Requirements: the toolbox requires Matlab and the Matlab Signal Processing Toolbox. We've tested the ADT with Matlab R2011b on Mac OSX, Matlab R2013a on Linux.

Actually getting started: try the demo scripts in the root directory of this distribution.
