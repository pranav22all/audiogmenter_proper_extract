%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Name: degradation_applyLowpassFilter
% Date: 2013-04
% Programmer: Matthias Mauch
%
% Description:
% - applies a lowpass filter to the audio
%
% Input:
%   f_audio      - audio signal \in [-1,1]^{NxC} with C being the number of
%                  channels
%   timepositions_beforeDegr - some degradations delay the input signal. If
%                             some points in time are given via this
%                             parameter, timepositions_afterDegr will
%                             return the corresponding positions in the
%                             output. Set to [] if unavailable. Set f_audio
%                             and samplingFreq to [] to compute only
%                             timepositions_afterDegr.
%
% Input (optional): parameter
%   .stopFrequency = 200     - stop band edge frequency in Hz
%   .passFrequency =         - pass band edge frequency in Hz,
%                              default is 0.5 x [stop band edge frequency]
%
% Output:
%   f_audio_out  - audio output signal
