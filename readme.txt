Welcome to Audiogmenter, a MATLAB Toolbox for Audio Data Augmentation.

In order to start, add Audiogmenter to your MATLAB path. You just need to
enter folder Audiogmenter and digit addpath(genpath(pwd)) on the Command Window.

Then you must install the Large Time Frequency Analisys Toolbox, which is included
in tools/audio. In order to do that, use the script ltfatstart from the Command Window.

A more detailed documentation is provided in the Help Section. Change your folder to 
Audiogmenter and press the Help button (the one with the question mark on the Home).
When you scroll down the menu on the left, you can see the section Audiogmenter Toolbox.
There you can find a description of the main functions in Audiogmenter.
